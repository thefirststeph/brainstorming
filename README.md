## Thoughts

"What about a website similar to earlybird search, but instead of finding bad websites, it finds 

-Free nearby clinics
-Free shelters for women experiencing domestic violence or homeless
-Finds babysitters for women who are struggling and are searching for jobs or already working to make ends meet"

Based on the criteria provided in the search

A common problem women experiencing domestic violence is they are dependent on the man they are with and in order to leave they need 

-a safe place to go to and a chance to make a start 
-resources to help them find jobs and make enough money to build a foundation
-and somebody to watch their children while they are building this foundation

If they have children

That's a great idea - I wonder if we can have a community aspect to this too

Yeah I think that could be a cool idea! Maybe we can incorporate reviews and ratings from the community since we're not necessarily curating it

We could utilize this with a few google apis to calculate the zip code, plug that in to the yelp API based on certain preset search queries (nearby clinics, shelters, babysitters, and other resources that are available based on some kind of interface).
